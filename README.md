# Table Wizard

**Table Wizard** is a lightweight web tool for data arrangement and logic-based table customization.

## Description

Table Wizard allows you to create customized tables that handle **numeric conditions** based on your criteria.

You can define appearance rules for specific values in rows or columns:

- **Example 1:** “I want the number 7 to appear **exactly 2 times** in my table.”
- **Example 2:** “I want the number 3 to appear **at least 3 times** in row number 1.”
- **Example 3:** “I want the number 9 to appear **exactly 0 times** in column number 8.”

This makes the tool ideal for structured layouts, scheduling, or constraint-based logic.
