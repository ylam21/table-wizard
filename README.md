# Table Wizard
Data Arrangement Tool

Table Wizard allows you to create customized tables based on your criteria, handling two types of data: **numbers** and **strings**.

You can adjust the appearance of specific data types by setting conditions such as quotas or ranges. <br/>
*Example: "I want the number 5 to appear exactly 2 times in my table."*

Additionally, you can control how neighboring cells interact. <br/>
*Example: "I don't want the number 1 next to the number 2."*
