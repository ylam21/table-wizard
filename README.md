# Table Wizard
Data Arrangement Tool

Table Wizard allows you to create customized tables based on your criteria, handling two types of data: **numbers** and **strings**.

You can adjust the appearance of specific data types by setting conditions. <br/>
*Example 1: "I want the number 7 to appear exactly 2 times in my table."* <br/>
*Example 2: "I want the number 3 to appear minimum 3 times in my row number 1."* <br/>
*Example 3: "I want the number 9 to appear exactly 0 times in column number 8."* <br/>
